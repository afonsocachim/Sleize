# Basic components

**Sleize** is made up of *four* basic structures:

1. Notebooks â†’ contain sections
2. Sections â†’ contain notes
3. Notes â†’ contains your text blocks
4. Sources â†’ your pdfs and videos that you reference in your notes

# Getting started

1. In order to get started click on your First section
1. Then click on your first note that should appear on the sidebar next to your section title
1. You are now inside your first note, where you can write all your thoughts
1. To search inside your note use the shortcut **ctrl+f**

# Shortcuts

Sleize provides shortcuts to improve you workflow, you can see all shortcuts by pressing **ctrl+h**

# Adding Sources

1. To add a source go to the bottom of the sidebar and click on the add sources icon
1. Choose which type of source you would like to add (Web article, Pdf, Video, Online Video)
1. After you have added your source click on the show sources icon next to it
1. Click on the pdf or video you would like to see

## Viewing pdfs

Sleize allows you to highlight pdfs and pass those highlights to your notes
There are two types of highlights text
1. Text highlights - simply select the text
1. Area highlights - click alt and then select the area

After you have selected the area or text a popup will appear \n
If you want to pass the highlight to a note make sure the note is opened alongside the pdf first \n
After that click on the pin icon ðŸ“Œ, and add your highlight \n

To search inside a pdf use the shortcut **ctrl+p**

## Viewing videos

To view a video simply click on the video source once you have added it \n

- **ctrl+p** â†’ pause/start the video

# Flashcards

If you have never used flashcards before here is a little bit of the terminology \n
Imagine we want to know the capital of Portugal \n
So that we can remember this fact we could start by having two flashcards with one question each:

- What is the capital of Portugal? |Lisbon|
- Which country has Lisbon as its capital? |Portugal|

In this case |Lisbon| and |Portugal| would be our *clozes* aka things that will be hidden when we review the question. Another way to write this would be: \n

- The capital of |Portugal| is |Lisbon| \n

And here we would have one flashcard with two clozes \n

## Creating our first flashcards

First we need to create a question block

1. Select the text to make into a question block
1. Then we can create a question block in two ways
1. Either use the shortcut **ctrl+shift+a** or click on the arrow in the hovering toolbar and select the question block option

Then we need to create a cloze

1. For example: What is the capital of Portugal? |Lisbon|
1. Select |Lisbon| and  in the hovering toolbar click on the **C** icon
1. You can also use the shortcuts **ctrl+shift+c** or **ctrl+shift+d**

### A little bit more about clozes

Each cloze has a number associated to it, for example:

- I like |pizza|1 and |chocolate|2

Pizza would be cloze 1 and chocolate would be cloze two \n
When we review we would have two flashcards:

- I like _____ and chocolate
- I like pizza and |||||||||

But we can also want to hide them both at the same time, all we need to is change the cloze numbers to:

- I like |pizza|1 and |chocolate|1

To change the cloze number simply place your mouse over the cloze and when the tooltip popups select and change the number

# Creating questions with images

Let's start by adding an image first, we can do it in two ways:
1. Copy and paste into the text an image or an image file
1. Or in the pdf select an area and pass it to the note

After you have an image
1. Pass your mouse over the image
1. Two icons will appear one with *Image occlusion*, and other to *Add caption*
1. Click on image occlusion to start

Image occlusion
1. To create a cloze click either the rectangle or the circle tool and then select the area you would like to hide
1. Clozes must have a minimum width and height slightly higher than the space their number occupies
1. To change the number of a cloze select it then change the number in the input and hit the check icon
1. To move a cloze around use the select tool
1. To delete a cloze simply select it and click on the remove button
1. **Remember to save the changes by clicking on the save icon!**

# Reviewing flashcards

You can review your flashcards by note, section, notebook or all together \n
- By note: If a note has flashcards to review a study icon will appear on top of it which you can click to start reviewing
- By section or notebook: Pass your mouse over the section or notebook if there are flaschards to review the review icon will be active
- To study all notes in the home screen pass your mouse over the Notebooks text and click on the study icon. Alternatively you can use **ctrl+s**

## Inside the review screen

Simply click show answer for each flashcard and then use the correct or wrong answer button

- **Space** â†’ equivalent to pressing show card and pressing correct
- **1** â†’ equivalent to pressing wrong answer
- **2** â†’ equivalent to pressing right answer
- **esc** â†’ exit review screen


# Browsing all notes

- To browse all your notes click **ctrl+shift+f** then type to find your note\n
- If you click **enter** you will go to the first note in the list
