Bugfixes

- Choose note dialog picks the parent note instead of the note itself

Improvement

- When clicking backspace inside an empty node reset said node properties (careful with list interaction)
- When changing a source reference find directly source nodes to change
- Having a collection for slateNodes
- Lazy loading in slate for better performance in very big files
- Pdf when changing zoom highlights change before pdf so there is a funny mismatch
- Pdf when resizing / moving an image it flickers in the old position
